Title: How Do Firms Respond to Gender Quotas?: Evidence From California’s SB826
Abstract: Quotas are often discussed as policy levers that can increase organizational diversity, but there is
much controversy about whether they can achieve gains in diverse representation without harming organizational
outcomes. In 2018, California passed a gender quota requiring the presence of at least one
woman on corporate boards by the end of 2019. Exploiting variation in the board’s gender composition
induced by the quota, I show that gender diverse boards do not adversely affect various measures of
board quality. These results challenge the theory that the prevalence of all-male boards is driven by a
scarcity of qualified female candidates. Instead, I provide evidence that two channels contribute to the
lack of gender parity on boards – negative stereotypes of female directors held by investors and a lack
of female connections to corporate leaders. These findings indicate that frictions in the labor market
prevent some qualified women from obtaining board positions.
