                How Do Firms Respond to Gender Quotas? Evidence From

              <p>
                This study examines the role of search frictions and gendered differences in human capital in contributing to the prevalence of all-male corporate boardrooms.
                I use California’s SB826, enacted in 2018 and requiring at least one female director on corporate boards by 2019, as a policy shock.
                Using a difference in differences design comparing listed California-based firms to listed non-California based firms, I find the quota increased the female share of boards by 11 percentage points while increasing the share of out-of-network and first-time female directors by 3 percentage points.
                Other human capital measures, corporate governance, and financial outcomes remained stable. 
                The traditional shift-share instrumental variables approach used in related research dramatically over-states point-estimates, as pre-reform diversity is correlated with firm-size and growth trajectories. 
                My results indicate SB826 reduced firms’ reliance on existing networks, suggesting that search frictions, rather than a lack of qualified candidates, previously contributed to the persistence of all-male boards.

                Do Non-Compete Agreements Help or Hurt Workers? Evidence from the NLSY97 (with Xiangru Li and Luke Rawling)

              <h4>Abstract</h4>
              <p>

                While non-compete agreements (NCs) are prevalent, the incentives driving their use and their causal effects on workers remain poorly understood. 
                We develop a model with asymmetric information to show that NCs shift the nature of allocative inefficiency by reducing inefficient quits and increasing inefficient retention, while mitigating the canonical hold-up problem. 
                The model predicts that NCs are more likely to be used in industries with high returns on industry-specific investments, and that signers have longer job tenures, higher contracted wages, and receive more firm-provided investment than similar workers without such agreements. 
                To test these predictions, we use panel data from the NLSY97 and a difference-in-differences research design to estimate the causal impact of signing an NC. 
                We find that NCs raise job tenures by 6% and lead to an immediate wage increase of 10%. 
                Six years after signing, the wage premium falls to 5%. There is also substantial heterogeneity across worker demographics, with non-white, non-college and lower-wage workers experiencing lower wage-growth after signing an NC. 
                Consistent with the theory, NC usage is more prevalent in industries with high returns on experience and among workers who perform sophisticated tasks.
                While the theory links NCs to firm investment, we find no evidence of increased investment in formal training, suggesting investments prompted by the agreement are likely informal. 
                Our findings caution against blanket bans on non-compete usage.
