                How Do Firms Respond to Gender Quotas? Evidence From

              <h4>Abstract</h4>
              <p>
                More than one-third of US-listed companies had all-male corporate boards in 2015. 
                Quotas are discussed as policy levers to increase gender diversity, but there is much controversy whether they can increase female representation without harming organizational outcomes. 
                Using the passage of a California law in 2018 that required the presence of at least one woman on corporate boards by the end of the following year, 
                I estimate the effects of gender quotas on firm performance. I find the quota reduced the share of all-male boards by twenty-five percentage points within one year, 
                with no reductions in operating performance, firm values, or shareholder returns within three years. 
                These results question why all-male boards were prevalent prior to the legislation. 
                I find that women directors are less likely to possess top-level experience and employment connections with corporate executives, which both appear as viable explanations. 
                These findings provide insight on why women continue to lack representation in corporate leadership.

                Do Non-Compete Agreements Help Workers? Evidence from the NLSY (Full Paper Coming Soon)
              </h2>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Abstract</h4>
              <p>
                Non-compete agreements are provisions within employment contracts that prevent 
                workers from joining competing firms. They are prevalent in the US workforce, with 38% of 
                workers having signed such clauses at some point in their careers, but there is limited research on 
                the type of workers who sign these agreements. Using newly released panel data on the usage of 
                non-compete agreements from the NLSY, I find that non-compete signers earn 6 dollars more per 
                hour and remain with their employers for 3 more months than individuals without such agreements. 
                Non-compete signers also receive more employer-provided training, but do not experience higher 
                wage growth. 

                These facts are rationalized through a theoretical model that builds upon Hashimoto (1981). Under 
                the model’s assumptions, which includes the premise that the contract is not renegotiated, I show 
                that non-compete agreements can create one market failure – inefficient lack of job separation –
                while mitigating a separate market failure – inefficient provision of industry-specific training by 
                firms. The model yields the predictions that (i) non-compete agreements are more likely to be used 
                in industries where firms must share information that make the worker more productive at 
                competing firms, (ii) non-compete signers have longer job tenures, and (iii) non-compete signers 
                receive more firm-provided training. All predictions appear to hold in the data.
