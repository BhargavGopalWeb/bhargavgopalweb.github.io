                How Do Firms Respond to Gender Quotas? Evidence From

              <p>
                This study examines the impact of California’s SB826, enacted in 2018 and requiring at least one female director on corporate boards by 2019, on financial performance and governance. 
                The quota reduced the share of all-male boards by 24 percentage points without harming financial performance from 2018 to 2021. 
                Governance measures remained stable. Firms responded with both tokenism and meaningful integration, with tokenism more common in larger boards and those in male-dominated industries. 
                I find that SB826 reduced firms’ reliance on existing networks, suggesting that network barriers may have previously prevented some qualified women from joining boards.

                Do Non-Compete Agreements Help or Harm Workers? (with Xiangru Li and Luke Rawling)

              <h4>Abstract</h4>
              <p>

                While non-compete agreements (NCs) are prevalent, the incentives driving their use and their causal effects on workers remain poorly understood. 
                We develop a model with asymmetric information to show that NCs shift the nature of allocative inefficiency by reducing inefficient quits and increasing inefficient retention, while mitigating the canonical hold-up problem. 
                The model predicts that NCs are more likely to be used in industries with high returns on industry-specific investments, and that signers have longer job tenures, higher wages, and receive more firm-provided investment than similar workers without such agreements. 
                To test these predictions, we use panel data from the NLSY97 and a difference-in-differences research design to estimate the causal impact of signing an NC. 
                We find that NCs raise job tenures by 6% and lead to an immediate wage increase of 10%. 
                Six years after signing, the wage premium falls to 5%. There is also substantial heterogeneity across worker demographics, with non-white, non-college and lower-wage workers experiencing lower wage-growth after signing an NC. 
                While the theory links NCs to firm investment, we find no evidence of increased investment in formal training, suggesting investments prompted by the agreement are likely informal. 
                Our findings caution against blanket bans on non-compete usage, favoring a more targeted approach focusing on lower-wage workers.
